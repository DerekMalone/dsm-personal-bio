    "about": "Prior to beginning my journey in software development, I worked as a Marketing Specialist in the Insurance field. I enjoyed the opportunities that insurance gave me to work with individuals and provide assistance in their times of need. It allowed me to gain knowledge and resolve complex situations using problem solving skills while working in a team environment. When a good friend of mine introduced me to the concept of transitioning to software development, I realized that the tech field would allow me to continue to use those skills that I enjoyed, without the many distractions that would arise on a daily basis. This started my love of software development that has continued to grow with every new technology I encounter.",
